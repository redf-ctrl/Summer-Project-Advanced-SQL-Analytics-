# SQL-Driven Inventory Optimization for Retail

> A SQL-driven solution to solve inventory inefficiencies for a retail case study. This project includes a relational database schema and advanced SQL queries to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like stockout rates and inventory turnover, providing data-backed recommendations for optimization.

***

### Project Context
This repository showcases a data analytics solution for a retail inventory case study from the **Consulting & Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati**. The project addresses common retail challenges like stockouts and overstocking by leveraging advanced SQL to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence.

### Core Features
* **Relational Database Schema**: A comprehensive schema was designed to structure and normalize the raw inventory, sales, and supplier data.
* **Advanced SQL Query Suite**: A collection of complex queries using **CTEs, Window Functions, and aggregations** to calculate critical KPIs.
* **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Analytical outputs translated into actionable business strategies for supply chain optimization and cost reduction.

### Showcase
The core of this project is a suite of advanced SQL queries used to analyze inventory data to identify inefficiencies. These queries calculate key metrics like **inventory turnover**, **stockout rates**, and **average inventory age**.

The complete, documented SQL scripts and the full schema design are available as `.sql` files in this repository.

### Key Business Recommendations
Analysis of the data led to several high-impact recommendations:
* Implement **dynamic reordering policies** and Just-in-Time (JIT) models to reduce overstocking costs by up to 40% for certain products.
* Introduce **supplier performance scorecards** to mitigate stockouts caused by inconsistent lead times, especially in the electronics segment.
